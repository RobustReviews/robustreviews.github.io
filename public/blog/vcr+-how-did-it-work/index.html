<p><em>Remember VideoPlus aka VCR+?</em> Those codes that you used to find in newspapers and listings magazines to program your video recorder?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="is-it-true-vcr-was-invented-because-a-mathematics-professor-couldnt-set-his-vcr-to-record-a-baseball-game">Is it true VCR+ was invented because a mathematics professor couldn&rsquo;t set his VCR to record a baseball game?</h2>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s entirely true. You can even <a href="https://charlierose.com/videos/25649">watch Henry Yuen</a> (the co-inventor) discussing the very matter on the <em>Charlie Rose</em> TV programme back in 2002.</p>
<p>Sources suggest this happened in either <strong>1986 or 1988</strong>, but at some point in that period, the all-round clever chap Mr Yuen came up with the genius idea of <em>video scheduling codes</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-did-vcr-have-different-names-are-videoplus-showview-and-g-code-the-same">Why did VCR+ have different names? Are VideoPlus, ShowView, and G-Code the same?</h2>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>VideoPlus</strong> was what we knew it as in the UK, which worked fine here because <em>video</em> was both a noun and a verb.</p>
<p>A VCR would be called a <em>video</em>, as would a cassette (<em>&ldquo;Stick a video in the video&rdquo;</em> makes perfect sense here), and just to really confuse you, <em>&ldquo;to video something&rdquo;</em> meant to record.</p>
<p>In <strong>British English</strong>:<br>
<em>&ldquo;Put a video in the video so I can video <em>Pulp Video</em> so I don&rsquo;t have to go down the video shop and get the video out, ta.&rdquo;</em><br>
✔ Perfectly cogent to old Brits.</p>
<p>The term <em>VCR</em> was something we mostly heard on American TV shows—if you said <em>&ldquo;Put a VHS in the VCR&rdquo;</em>, it would have sounded weird in the UK in the &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s. Honestly, it still sounds clunky to me now.</p>
<p>More importantly, <strong>Philips owned the trademark &ldquo;VCR&rdquo; in Europe</strong> (Video Cassette Recording), so calling it <strong>VCR+</strong> here was a <strong>non-starter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>G-Code</strong> (Gemstar Code) was used in Japan, where <em>VCR</em> meant nothing, and also in some other markets. <strong>ShowView</strong> was used exclusively in Europe—though that name must have sounded oddly English in other languages.</p>
<p>Get in touch—<em>what did you call yours?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="does-vcr-still-work">Does VCR+ still work?</h2>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of confusion about how this system worked—many people assume it was <strong>a broadcasted signal</strong>, but it wasn’t.</p>
<p>VCR+ was <strong>never transmitted over the air</strong>. Instead, the codes were <strong>just a hash</strong> of the start time, channel, and duration.</p>
<p>GemStar simply <strong>partnered with newspapers and TV listings providers</strong> to print the codes in exchange for licensing their software. <em>That’s it, in a nutshell.</em> Naturally, the details were more complicated.</p>
<p>VCR+ simply became obsolete with the rise of <strong>streaming and hard-disk recorders</strong>. It no longer served a purpose. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36857370">last VCRs were made in July 2016</a>, so it’s hardly a <em>thing</em> anymore, is it?</p>
<p>That said, you <em>can</em> still use it—kind of.</p>
<p>If you want to get your old snotter of a machine down from the loft, you’ll need to download <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/VCRPlus+/">this C code</a> (or the Perl 5 version if you don’t think life is complicated enough) and compile it yourself.</p>
<p>However, it only seems to have about an <strong>80% success rate in the UK</strong>, and I had to modify it a bit to get it working.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-whats-this-hash-function-stuff">So, what’s this hash-function stuff?</h2>
<p>Well, imagine trying to pee in reverse…</p>
<p>Peeing &ldquo;forwards&rdquo; is, assuming adequate hydration, a fairly straightforward process. However, if you were to attempt to use your bits as a straw to suck it back up from the bowl (please don’t send me evidence of any attempts), you’d find yourself facing an impossible challenge. That’s about the best analogy I can come up with for how a hash function works.</p>
<p>There are, of course, long and tedious mathematical explanations, but in simple terms, a hash function is a clever set of calculations that can transform key pieces of information—such as start time, duration, and channel number—into a <strong>unique and non-obvious number</strong>.</p>
<p>If you’re presented with the code but don’t know the formula to work backwards, <strong>decoding it is practically impossible</strong>. This was rather neat for GemStar, as they could <strong>publish codes daily</strong> in TV listings <strong>alongside the necessary details (start time, duration, and channel)</strong>. However, without their proprietary software, you’d have almost <strong>zero chance</strong> of working out how the codes were generated.</p>
<p>The maths behind this had to be precise to ensure that each unique programme combination (channel, time, and duration) would <strong>always</strong> generate a <strong>single, unique code</strong> within a <strong>month-long period</strong>—<strong>collisions were not allowed</strong>. For example, <em>Casualty</em> at <strong>20:00 for 50 minutes on a Saturday</strong> could <strong>never</strong> produce the same code as <em>Spatz</em> at <strong>15:50 for 25 minutes the following Friday</strong>.</p>
<p>All the device—whether it’s a <strong>VCR or a dedicated unit</strong>—has to &ldquo;know&rdquo; is <strong>the magic formula</strong> to work backwards. Essentially, it&rsquo;s just <strong>a glorified calculator</strong>. It can take a code like <code>202403</code> and decode it, unpacking the necessary details to set your machine to record <em>The Bill</em> <strong>tonight at 19:30 for 30 minutes</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="shorter-codes-for-prime-time">Shorter Codes for Prime Time</h2>
<p>Prime-time programming (though I haven&rsquo;t found an exact definition of what this means in VCR+) and <strong>more popular channels</strong> were designed to <strong>produce shorter codes</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, I’ve seen <code>3</code> used as a code for BBC News on BBC One. However, if you wanted to record <strong>a niche overnight broadcast on a lesser-known channel</strong>, you’d likely have to enter a <strong>full 8-digit code</strong> instead.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-so-complicated">Why So Complicated?</h2>
<p>The hashing process had to be <strong>intentionally convoluted</strong> to <strong>prevent the codes from being predictable</strong> without <strong>GemStar’s software</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the system incorporated <strong>an extra layer of obfuscation</strong>—meaning that the <strong>same programme</strong> could sometimes have <strong>different codes</strong>. This was a deliberate anti-piracy measure, designed so that <strong>one TV listings magazine couldn’t simply copy another</strong>. An <strong>extra hidden factor</strong> was included in the calculations and <strong>unpacked by the decoder</strong>, making it <strong>instantly obvious to GemStar</strong> if someone was <strong>stealing codes</strong> from a competitor.</p>
<p>So, in summary—<strong>deceptively simple, yet astonishingly complicated!</strong></p>
