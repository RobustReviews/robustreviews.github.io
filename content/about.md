## **A Quick Bio**  

In case you were wondering, my name is **Andy**, and I live in **East Anglia, UK**. I've had a few different jobs over the years, but currently, I work full-time in **industrial electronics and calibration**.  

I‚Äôve had a **lifelong passion for all things nerdy**, especially in the world of electronics. I was *that* kid who loved **taking things apart**, and a chance encounter with a **Betamax machine around 1997** kicked off my obsession with **old video formats**.  

***  

## **FAQ**  

- **_"Don‚Äôt I recognize you from...?"_**  
  Quite likely! If it involves a pub, or if you work in a factory, there's a chance I‚Äôve passed through as part of my day job. But realistically, it‚Äôs probably the pub.  

- **_"Marital status?"_**  
  Divorced, currently single as of June 2025. *(Form an orderly queue, ladies.)*  

- **_"Something about films, television, or computer games?"_**  
  Never really had an interest in any of them. Stopped watching TV entirely around **2015** (including streaming), have seen only a handful of films in my life, and never played video games beyond **Nokia Snake**.  

  I did once play *Streets of Rage* on Christmas afternoon **c. 1994** on a MegaDrive. My mum beat me, and in what I believe the kids call a **rage-quit**, I launched an ashtray across the living room. *(Ah, the '90s...)*  
  I got a smack, was sent to bed early, and I‚Äôve been **sworn off video games ever since**.  

- **_"Biggest fear?"_**  
  **Flying.** Severe aviophobia. Yes, I‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîincluding medication. Even thinking about it makes me feel sick. I don‚Äôt even like going into aircraft that are *on the ground* at exhibitions. Even if they have **no engines**, I still panic.  

- **_"Favourite videotape format?"_**  
  **VHS.**  

- **_"Least favourite videotape format?"_**  
  **Betamax.** *(Yes, really.)*  

- **_"Favourite music?"_**  
  *Anything* that is **not** musical theatre or **Fleetwood Mac**. I *really* dislike Fleetwood Mac.  

- **_"Callsign?"_**  
  **2EOYOS.** I generally avoid using it in videos because it gets irritating. Mostly on 2m/70cm, occasionally on 10m, but not really into HF stuff.  

- **_"Can you stop squinting in your videos..?"_**  
  **Sorry!** My eyesight is **pretty terrible**. I have to wear thick, uncomfortable contact lenses, and I usually take them out for videos‚Äîso I can‚Äôt **focus on anything.**  

- **_"Most embarrassing moment?"_**  
  My **life** is a long series of embarrassing moments.  

  But one that‚Äôs safe to tell? Attempting to eat a **box of stuffing mix** at 08:30 *live on the radio*.  
  It **turned to concrete** in my mouth, leaving me **unable to speak** during a live segment.  
  I tried to wash it down with coffee, which made things **ten times worse**.  
  I ended up **pulling lumps of it out of my mouth into a studio bin‚Äîon live FM radio.**  

- **_"Something else?"_**  
  Drop me an **email**‚ÄîI *might* answer...
