# Welcome to the RobustReviews YouTube Channel Website

![The Robust Reviews Channel Logo](/images/Robust_Reviews_pink_Helmet_YouTube_logo.webp)


This is the website for extra information about stuff that I've covered on my YouTube channel which is usually a mix of amateur radio equipment reviews and retro-technology.

I've spent too long designing websites - and frankly - I don't care any more, so instead enjoy this superfast basic site with no nasties, it's nothing more than pure HTML! :P It's basically one step-up from **Teletext**. The whole site weighs less than 100kb.

If you're wondering who's that cool guy emptying out the innards of some old bit of electronics with a pink hard hat on... that's me! Welcome :)
